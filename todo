List od things todo

1. [v] When the user exists the chat , the history should be removed, rightnow is almost saved in the local storage
2. [x] if the admin is not connected and ai is not enabled, then a response from the chat should say now  we are not connected to the admin, please try again later







OKay it half done,  what is hapening now in @fa.js  (the chat widget) 

Current state 

1-  imagine the user exceed  the limit of the chat
2-  chat doesnt work

but (the problem happening )

if the user is not exceed the limit of the chat

1-  chat works
2- [x] FIXED: if the visitor exceed limits while chatting, its  still going off limit,  it should be off the moment ai responses finish even in active chat
3. [x] FIXED: AI response counting was incrementing by 2 or 3 instead of 1 (duplicate counting issue resolved)
4. [x] FIXED: Widget was completely closed when AI limits exceeded - now only AI is disabled, human agents can still chat
5. [x] FIXED: Removed "AI response limit reached" message - AI limits are now completely transparent to users
