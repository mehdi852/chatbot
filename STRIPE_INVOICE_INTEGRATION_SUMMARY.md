# Stripe Invoice Integration Summary

## Overview
Updated the billing system to properly handle and display Stripe invoice numbers, and added functionality to download invoices directly from Stripe.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Updated Stripe Webhook** (`app/api/webhook/stripe/route.js`)

**Issues Fixed:**
- ✅ Fixed `checkout.session.completed` to store proper Stripe invoice IDs instead of generated numbers
- ✅ Fixed `invoice.paid` to use `invoice.id` instead of `invoice.number` (which doesn't exist)
- ✅ Added logic to retrieve actual Stripe invoice IDs from sessions and subscriptions

**Key Changes:**
```javascript
// OLD - Generated custom invoice number
const invoiceNumber = `INV-${Date.now()}`;

// NEW - Get actual Stripe invoice ID
let invoiceNumber = `INV-${Date.now()}`; // Fallback
try {
    if (session.invoice) {
        const invoice = await stripe.invoices.retrieve(session.invoice);
        invoiceNumber = invoice.id; // Use Stripe invoice ID
    } else if (session.subscription) {
        // Get the latest invoice from the subscription
        const subscription = await stripe.subscriptions.retrieve(session.subscription, {
            expand: ['latest_invoice']
        });
        if (subscription.latest_invoice && typeof subscription.latest_invoice === 'object') {
            invoiceNumber = subscription.latest_invoice.id;
        }
    }
} catch (invoiceError) {
    console.log('Could not retrieve invoice from session, using fallback:', invoiceError.message);
}
```

### 2. **New Invoice Download API** (`app/api/billing/download-invoice/route.js`)

**Features:**
- ✅ Verifies invoice ownership before allowing download
- ✅ Fetches Stripe invoices directly using Stripe API
- ✅ Returns Stripe-hosted PDF URLs and download links
- ✅ Provides fallback for non-Stripe invoices

**Key Functionality:**
- `GET /api/billing/download-invoice?invoiceId={id}&userId={userId}` - Download invoice
- `POST /api/billing/download-invoice` - Get detailed invoice information with Stripe data

### 3. **Enhanced Billing Page** (`app/dashboard/billing/page.jsx`)

**UI Improvements:**
- ✅ Distinguishes between Stripe invoices (`in_xxxxxxxx`) and custom invoices
- ✅ Shows "Stripe Invoice" label for actual Stripe invoices
- ✅ Different download button text: "Download" for Stripe invoices, "PDF" for custom ones
- ✅ Loading states for download operations
- ✅ Error handling for failed downloads

**Visual Changes:**
- Invoice numbers display with proper prefixes
- Stripe invoices are clearly labeled
- Download functionality with loading indicators
- Better error messaging

### 4. **Invoice Detection Logic**

**How it Works:**
```javascript
// Detect Stripe invoices by their ID format
invoice.invoice_number.startsWith('in_') ? 'Stripe Invoice' : 'Custom Invoice'

// Different download behavior
if (data.downloadUrl) {
    // Direct PDF download from Stripe
    window.open(data.downloadUrl, '_blank');
} else if (data.hosted_invoice_url) {
    // Open Stripe hosted invoice page
    window.open(data.hosted_invoice_url, '_blank');
} else {
    // Fallback for custom invoices
    alert('Invoice download not available for this invoice type. Please contact support.');
}
```

## How It Works Now

### For New Subscriptions:
1. User completes Stripe checkout
2. `checkout.session.completed` webhook fires
3. System retrieves the actual Stripe invoice ID from the session/subscription
4. Stores proper Stripe invoice ID (format: `in_xxxxxxxxxx`)
5. User sees "Stripe Invoice" in billing page
6. Download button opens actual Stripe PDF

### For Recurring Payments:
1. Stripe processes recurring payment
2. `invoice.paid` webhook fires  
3. System stores the Stripe invoice ID (`invoice.id`)
4. User can download the official Stripe invoice PDF

### In the Billing Page:
- **Stripe Invoices**: Show as `#in_xxxxxxxxxx` with "Stripe Invoice" subtitle
- **Custom Invoices**: Show as `#INV-timestamp` with "Monthly Subscription" subtitle
- **Download**: Stripe invoices open official Stripe PDFs, others show not available message

## Testing Steps

1. **Create a test subscription** through your pricing page
2. **Check webhook logs** - should see proper Stripe invoice IDs being stored
3. **Visit billing page** - invoices should show with correct labels
4. **Click download** - should open Stripe's hosted invoice PDF
5. **Verify invoice numbers** match between your app and Stripe dashboard

## Environment Variables Required

```bash
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_key_here
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_from_stripe_listen_command
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

## Database Schema Impact

No database changes needed - using existing `Invoices` table:
- `invoice_number` field now stores actual Stripe invoice IDs
- Backwards compatible with existing custom invoice numbers

## Future Improvements

1. **PDF Generation**: Could add PDF generation library for custom invoices
2. **Invoice History**: Could sync all historical invoices from Stripe
3. **Invoice Templates**: Custom invoice templates for non-Stripe payments
4. **Bulk Download**: Allow downloading multiple invoices at once

## Key Benefits

✅ **Real Stripe Integration**: Users get official Stripe invoices  
✅ **Professional Experience**: Downloads work like any other SaaS  
✅ **Accounting Compliance**: Proper invoice numbers for tax/accounting  
✅ **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for edge cases  
✅ **User-Friendly**: Clear labeling of invoice types
